*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

The program "matrix" reads integers from a data file, and uses
the data to implement two matrices.  It then outputs the matrices,
and computes and outputs the sum and product of the matrices.

Name:  main.cpp
   Main program.  This is the driver program that calls sub-functions
   to read data from an input file, use the data to create two matrices,
   and compute and display their sum and product.

Name:  matrix.h
   Contains the definition for the class matrix.  

Name: matrix.cpp
   Defines and implements the matrix class for implementing a matrix.  
   This class provides routines to construct and get the matrix, as
   well as overloaded operators to add and multpliply two matrices.

Name: matrix_functions.h
   Contains the prototypes for the matrix program support functions.

Name: matrix_functions.cpp
   Includes functions to display a greeting, populate two arrays
   from a data file, and display the sum and product of two matrices.
